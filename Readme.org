* One Page Rules via Tabletop Simulator: FOR THE WIN!
This mod for TTS takes an army listing and, using mappings of units to asset bundles, automatically creates all of the necessary instances to start playing.

The goal is to be able to:
  1. Create a list
  2. Press a button
  3. Play in TTS

* Development
Syncing to TTS is done by:
  1. Create target object in TTS
  2. Executing =sync.py= using that object's guid
  3. Profit

Get the GUID of the object by right-clicking on it and going to =scripting -> guid= in the context menu.

#+begin_src shell :eval never
  python sync.pl GUID
#+end_src

=sync.pl= depends on:
  - argparse
  - watchdog

See ~python sync.py --help~ for more options.

** Emacs
Helper functions for use in Emacs are a in =tts.el=.

  - ~tts-set-guid~
  - ~tts-do-upload~
